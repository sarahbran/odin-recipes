<h2> Description </h2>
<p>
    Biryani is a flavorful and fragrant dish that is popular in the Indian subcontinent.
    To make biryani, you will need to first marinate the meat of your choice
    (such as chicken, beef or lamb) in a mixture of yogurt, spices, and herbs.
    Some popular spices used in biryani include turmeric, cumin, coriander,
    and garam masala. Once the meat is marinated, it is then sautéed with onions,
    ginger, and garlic, until it is cooked through.
</p>
<p>
    Next, the rice is cooked separately in a mixture of water, saffron, and spices
    such as cinnamon and cloves. Once the rice is cooked, it is then layered with
    the meat mixture in a pot and cooked together on low heat. This allows the flavors
    to meld and the rice to absorb the juices from the meat. Once the biryani is cooked,
    it is garnished with fried onions, cashews, and raisins, and is often served with
    yogurt or raita on the side.
