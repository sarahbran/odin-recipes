<h2> Steps </h2>
<ol>
    <li> Prepare the Cajun spice blend by mixing together paprika, cayenne pepper,
        garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper in a small bowl. </li>
    <li> Rinse the salmon fillet and pat it dry with paper towels. </li>
    <li> Rub the Cajun spice blend over the entire surface of the salmon fillet,
        making sure to cover it evenly.</li>
    <li> Preheat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. If you are using a
        skillet, add some oil or butter to the pan to prevent sticking. </li>
    <li> Place the salmon fillet in the skillet or on the grill pan and cook for
        about 3-4 minutes per side for a 1/2-inch thickness, or until the fish is
        cooked through and the internal temperature reaches 145Â°F.</li>
    <li> If desired, you can add some vegetables such as bell peppers, onions, and
        tomatoes to the skillet or grill pan to cook alongside the salmon.</li>
    <li> Once the salmon is cooked through, remove it from the heat and serve it
        immediately. You can garnish with fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro or
        squeeze some lemon or lime juice for added flavor.</li>
        <p> Grilling and baking methods will also work. Cooking time may vary depending
            on the thickness of the salmon, the cooking method used, and the desired
            level of doneness.</p>
